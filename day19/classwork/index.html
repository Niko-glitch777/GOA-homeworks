        <p>Reptiles, as commonly defined, are a group of tetrapods with an ectothermic metabolism and amniotic <br>
            development. Living traditional reptiles comprise four orders: Testudines, Crocodilia, Squamata, and <br>
            Rhynchocephalia. About 12,000 living species of reptiles are listed in the Reptile Database.[2] The study <br>
            of the traditional reptile orders, customarily in combination with the study of modern amphibians, is called 
            herpetology.</p>

        <p>A mammal (from Latin mamma 'breast')[1] is a vertebrate animal of the class Mammalia (/məˈmeɪli.ə/). <br>
            Mammals are characterised by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands for feeding their young, <br>
            a broad neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. These characteristics <br>
            distinguish them from reptiles and birds, from which their ancestors diverged in the Carboniferous Period <br>
            over 300 million years ago. Around 6,640 extant species of mammals have been described and divided into 27 <br>
            orders.[2] The study of mammals is called mammalogy.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Sea creatures are diverse marine animals, ranging from small microorganisms to large mammals like <br>
            whales, and are often categorized as either vertebrates (like fish and mammals) or invertebrates <br>
            (like jellyfish and crabs). Examples include sharks, dolphins, octopuses, sea turtles, and many <br>
            species of fish and crustaceans</p>
