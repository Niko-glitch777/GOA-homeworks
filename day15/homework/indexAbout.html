<br><br><br><br>

    <p><u>A cartoon is a type of visual art that is typically drawn</u>
        , frequently animated, in an unrealistic or semi-realistic 
        style. The specific meaning has evolved, but the modern 
        usage usually refers to either: an image or series of 
        images intended for satire, caricature, or humor; or a 
        <mark>motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations 
        for its animation</mark>. Someone who creates cartoons in the 
        first sense is called a cartoonist,[1] and in the second 
        sense they are usually called an animator.</p>
