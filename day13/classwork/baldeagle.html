    <p>The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a bird of 
        prey found in North America. A sea eagle, it has two 
        known subspecies and forms a species pair with the 
        white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), which 
        occupies the same niche as the bald eagle in the 
        Palearctic. Its range includes most of Canada and 
        Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and 
        northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of 
        open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth 
        trees for nesting.</p>
