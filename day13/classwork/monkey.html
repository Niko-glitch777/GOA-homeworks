    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals 
        of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. 
        Traditionally,
         <mark>all animals in the group now known as simians are
          counted as monkeys except the apes.</mark> Thus monkeys, 
          in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic 
          grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are 
          included, monkeys and simians are synonyms.</p>
