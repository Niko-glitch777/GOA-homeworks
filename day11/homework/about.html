    <p><strong>football</strong> is played in accordance with the Laws of the 
    Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 
    and maintained <br>by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played 
    with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference.
    The two teams <br> compete to score goals by getting the ball 
    <i>into the other team's goal</i> <br> (between the posts, 
    under the bar, and fully across the goal line). When the 
    ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but 
    may <br> also use any other part of their body, except for 
    their hands or arms, <br>to control, strike, or pass the 
    ball; the head, chest, and thighs are commonly used. Only 
    <u>the goalkeepers may use their <br> hands and arms, but only 
    within their own penalty area. </u>The team that has scored 
    more goals at the end of the game is the winner. Depending 
    on the format of the <br> competition, <mark>an equal number of goals 
    scored may result in a draw</mark> being declared with 1 point 
    awarded to <br> each team, or the game may go into extra time or
     a penalty shoot-out.[4]</p>
